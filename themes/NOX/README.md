# NOX theme V0.1

I suggest setting the thumbnail resolution in PrusaSlicer a little bit higher (at least 50%):

```
thumbnails = 16x16,330x186
```

You also need to activate these settings in OctoDash:

**Settings > OctoDash > Preview by default while printing**
**Settings > OctoDash > Always use circular progress bar**
